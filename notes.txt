  - "Pure components"

    1. A pure component receives all its data as props, like a function receives all its data as arguments. It should have no side effects, including reading data from anywhere else, initiating network requests, etc.

    2. A pure component generally has no internal state. What it renders is fully driven by its input props. Rendering the same pure component twice with the same props should result in the same UI. There's no hidden state inside the component that would cause the UI to differ between the two renders.
