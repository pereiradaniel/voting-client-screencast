  - "Pure components"

    1. A pure component receives all its data as props, like a function receives all its data as arguments. It should have no side effects, including reading data from anywhere else, initiating network requests, etc.

    2. A pure component generally has no internal state. What it renders is fully driven by its input props. Rendering the same pure component twice with the same props should result in the same UI. There's no hidden state inside the component that would cause the UI to differ between the two renders.

  - react-hot vs react-hot-loader/webpack

    $ webpack-dev-server
    
    ERROR MESSAGE:

    ERROR in ./src/index.js
    
    Module build failed: Error: React Hot Loader: The Webpack loader is now exported separately. If you use Babel, we recommend that you remove "react-hot-loader" from the "loaders" section of your Webpack configuration altogether, and instead add "react-hot-loader/babel" to the "plugins" section of your .babelrc file. If you prefer not to use Babel, replace "react-hot-loader" or "react-hot" with "react-hot-loader/webpack" in the "loaders" section of your Webpack configuration.
